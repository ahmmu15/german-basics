# German Articles

This is something that most books out there start with; many of those books seem to be enjoying making it complicated; and many people also enjoy to scare people off with it 😒.

Why? Well, because articles in German follow the gender, **masculine** `مذكّر`, **feminine** `مؤنث` and **neuter** `جماد`; which in German, it's **grammatical**, not **biological** as it is in English and Arabic.

The thing is, you really don't have to worry about that! I've told you many times that even natives don't remember every single word's gender; they do know the most used ones; which is something you master by practicing *(aka. it takes time)* ;).

With that's been said, let's see what articles we have in German.

<br />

- **Der**: That's the `the`, `الـ`, for **masculine** words. <br />**Example**: `Der Mann` ➡️ *The Man* | `Der Tisch` ➡️ *The Table*.

<br />

- **Die**: That's the `the`, `الـ`, for **feminine** words. <br />**Example**: `Die Frau` ➡️ *The Woman* | `Die Tür` ➡️ *The Door*.

<br />

- **Das**: That's the `the`, `الـ`, for **neuter** words. <br />**Example**: `Das Fenster` ➡️ *The Window* | `Das Mädchen` ➡️ *The Girl*.

<br />

## The Indefinite Articles
And just like English, German does have `a`, like *a book*; however German doesn't have `an`. So, how to say that in German?

<br />

- **Ein**: That's the `a`, for **masculine** and **neuter** nouns. <br />**Example**: `Ein Mann` ➡️ *A Man* | `Ein Fenster` ➡️ *A Window*.

<br />

- **Eine**: That's the `a`, for **feminine** nouns. <br />**Example**: `Eine Frau` ➡️ *A Woman* | `Eine Tür` ➡️ *A Door*.
