# Pronouns

Just like most languages, German has its pronouns; however it has more pronouns than English, but less than Arabic ;). So let's learn those bastards :D.

::: tip
You will see that the **verb** is written in different ways when it's been used with pronouns; don't worry about this, we will learn later how it works ;).

<br />

## Singular Pronouns

#### Ich
That one means `I`, simple ha :)! In order to say **I am**, you say `Ich bin`.

- `Ich lese ein buch` means *I read a book*, and also *I'm reading a book* ... that's because there's no **present continuous** in German ;).

- `Ich bin Rafal`: *I am Rafal* | `Ich bin müde`: *I am tired* | `Ich bin froh`: *I am happy*.

<br />

#### Du
It means `you`, for single person; use it with **friends** and the **people you know well**; using it with people you meet for the first time considers **unpolite** :D! To say **You are**, you say `Du bist`.

- `Du liest ein buch` means *You read a book*, or *You're reading a book*.

- `Du bist wunderschön`: *You are beautiful* | `Du bist lustig`: *You are funny*.

<br />

#### Er
Means `he`, to say **he is**, you say `Er ist`.

- `Er liest ein buch` means *He reads a book*, or *He's reading a book*.

- `Er ist krank`: *He is sick* | `Er ist tot`: *He is dead* 💀.

<br />

#### Sie
Means `she`, to say **She is**, you say `sie ist`; this one is usually written with small case `s`, you'll learn why later :).

- `sie liest ein buch` means *She reads a book*, or *She's reading a book*.

- `sie ist wunderschön`: *She is beautiful* | `sie ist sehr nett`: *She is very nice* 😻.

<br />

#### Es
Means `It`, to say **It is**, you say `Es ist`.

- `Es regnet` means *It rains*, or *It's raining*.

- `Es ist schön`: *It is beautiful* | `Es ist wichtig`: *It is important*.


<br />

## Plural Pronouns

#### Wir
That one means `We`, to say **We are**, you say `Wir sind`.

- `Wir lesen ein buch` means *We read a book*, and also *We're reading a book*.

- `Wir sind glücklich`: *We are lucky* | `Wir sind zusammen`: *We are together* | `Wir sind zu hause`: *We are at home*.

<br />

#### Sie
Means `They`, to say **They are**, you say `Sie sind`.

- `Sie lesen ein buch` means *They read a book*, and also *They're reading a book*.

- `Sie sind sehr nett`: *They are very nice* | `Sie sind glücklich`: *They are lucky* | `Sie sind geschwister`: *They are siblings*.

<br />

#### Ihr
Means `You`, but for more than one person; think of it as the Arabic `انتما`, `انتم`, `انتن` all together (depends on the context); to say **You are**, you say `Ihr seid`. Use it with the people you know well.

- `Ihr lest ein buch` means *You read a book*, and also *You're reading a book*.

- `Ihr seid die besten`: *You are the best* | `Ihr seid männer`: *You are men* | `Ihr seid ruhig`: *You are calm*.

## Shitty Pronouns Explained!

First of all, you may noticed that **Sie** means `she` and `they`; and that may left you with a blank look on your face; confusion, then an inside scream: **HOW IN THE FUCK I SHOULD KNOW WHICH ONE IT MEANS WHEN I READ OR TALK TO SOMEONE!!** 😡

Before answering your question, let me add to your misery a little bit; **Sie** can also mean `you` :D. But fear not young lady; we will learn how you can differentiate between those in a super easy way ;).

Let's first know when does **Sie** mean `you`. Remember when I told you that **Du** means `you` but asked you **not** to use it with strangers? If so, then we're good to go; otherwise, scroll to top to check that again :P.

#### Sie

Means `you` and can be used with strangers, it's very formal and Germans expect you to call them that way when you reach them for the first time :). Notice that the `you` here is for **singular** and **plural**; depends on the context ;).

:::tip
**Sie** is always written with **capital letter** when it's been used as formal `You` ;).
:::

<br />

So, this sentence **Sie sind sehr nett** can mean:

- You are vey nice. (Singular) ➡️ `انت لطيف جدا`
- You are vey nice. (Plural) ➡️ `انتم \ انتن \ انتما \ لطيفون \ لطفاء جدا`

<br />

Oh yeah! and what about the **she** one? **HOW IN THE HELL SHOULD I .....** ☠️☠️☠️ .... Calm down young lady; it's easy, just keep reading! Jesus! :P

<br />

Remember when I told you that to say **She is**, you have to say **Sie ist**? If so, then you may also remember how the verb has taken **different conjugations** depends on the pronoun that it's been used with ;).

Let's quickly remind ourselves about the verb; it's **lesen** and it means `read`; this verb written as **liest** when it's used with `she`; and written as **lesen** when it's used with `they` and the formal `you`.

With that's been said, it's what come after the word **sie** that defines what **sie** should mean. If it's `ist` or `liest`, then it means **she**; otherwise, it's **they** or **you** (depends on the context) ;).

The `capital letter` can also be another factor to use to differentiate between **they**, and the formal **you**; remember that the formal **you** always written with a **capital letter**.

<br />

**Fuck you Ahmed! ... it's not like I'm gonna use the verb (read) all the time ... so how in the world ....!!!** 😡😡😡😡😡

Wooooo young lady, calm down a little; we will learn about the verbs togther; we have to take it easy, step by step ;) ... Things might sound confusing, but it's a matter of time, our brains are good in forming new connections ... just give it .. a time ;).

<br />

:::warning
If I was you, I would colsed the browser, not worried about it; came again a day later maybe, and my mind will be good to go, or it would make a little more sense ;).
