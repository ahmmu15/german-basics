# Pronunciation: The Basics (Part One)

As you know, every language has this weird thing called Pronunciation! :D. In this lesson, we're going to learn its basics.

<br />

- **Ch**: this might be the most tricky one for English speakers, but not for us :P, we Arabic speakers have this sound in our language ;). This one can be pronounced as the Arabic letter `Ø®` when it comes after `a`, `o`, `u`, or `au`.
**Example**: `Buch` means *Book* | `Loch` means *Hole*. `Arschloch` is *Asshole* btw! :P

- **Ch** can also be pronounced as soft `sh`, when it comes after `e`, `i`, `Ã¤`, `Ã¤u`, `Ã¶`, `Ã¼`, `n`, or `r`.
**Example**: `BÃ¼cher` means *Books* | `Ich` means *I* | `lÃ¤cheln` means *smile*.

::: tip
I think you can focus only on the first rule, where the `ch` is pronounced as `Ø®`; otherwise it's short `sh` ;).

<br />

- **Sch**: that's `sh`, it's always `sh` :D.
**Example**: `Schule` means *School* | `Schuhe` means *Shoes*.

- **Sp**: if you see that in the beginning of a word, then it's `shp`; so the `s` is pronounced as `sh`.
**Example**: `Sport` means *Sport* | `Spiel` means *Play* or *Game*.

- **St**: that's also `sht`, I mean the `s` is pronounced as `sh` if it comes in the beginning of a word.
**Example**: `Stop` means *Stop* | `Stadt` means *City*.

- **Au**: that sounds like the `ou` in *house*; something like *aw*.
**Example**: `Auto` means *Car* | `Traum` means *Dream* | `Frau` means *Woman*.

- **Ã„u**: this one sounds like the `oy` in the word *boy*.
**Example**: `LÃ¤uft` means *Walk* | `BÃ¤ume` means *Trees*.

- **Eu**: same as above, it's `oy` :).
**Example**: `Europa` means *Europe* | `Freund` means *Friend*.

- **Ei**: that sounds exactly like the word `eye` :D.
**Example**: `Mein` means *Mine* | `Reise` means *Travel*.

- **ie**: that's a **long** `e`.
**Example**: `Wie` means *How* | `Wieder` means *Again*.

- **Th**: not like English, this one is always `t` :).
**Example**: `Theater` means *Theater* | `Themen` means *Subjects* or *Topics*.

::: tip
The `h` is always silent, unless it's in the beginning of the word; it does however make the sound of the letter that comes before it longer; *for example* the word for the male teacher is `lehrer`, the `h` in this case, makes the `e` sounds longer; an example where it's been pronounced is `heute` which means *today*.

<br />

- **V**: this is `f` as mentioned before, but also a `v` in **foreign words**.
**Example**: `Vor` means *Before* | `Vase` means *Vase*.


That's enough for this lesson, we will continue with pronunciation in the next one; see you there ðŸ˜˜.
