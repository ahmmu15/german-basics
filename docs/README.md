# The German Alphabet - Part One

The best thing start with when learning new langauge is the alpahabet of the language, so we know what's there and how words are pronounced in that language; in this case, the German language :)

<br />

::: tip
Remember to fire up **Google Translate**, and listen to every German word mentioned here; so you know how it's been pronounced.

<br />

- **A**: That's *ah*, it's like the English `a` but you have to open your mouth when you say it; think of it like the letter `ÿß` in Arabic. 
**Example**: `Apfel` means *Appel* | `Mann` means *Man*.
