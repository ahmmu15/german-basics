# Grammmar Jargon

This is not a German lesson, but a reference for you to get back to whenever you come across one of these fukin grammatic jargon 🐶.

<br />

- **Nominative Case**: the nominative is used when the noun is the **subject** `الفاعل` of the sentence; *(aka. the one who's doing the action)*. In Arabic it's called `حالة الرفع`. **Example**: *The man buys the house*; `the man` is the **object** here.

<br />

- **Accusative Case**: when the noun is the **direct object** `المفعول به` *(aka. the **receiver** of the action in the sentence)*. You can say it's `حالة النصب`. **Example**: *The man buys the house*; `the house` is the **direct object** here.

<br />

- **Dative Case**: in addition to the direct object, many verbs can take a second object, the **indirect object** *(aka. to whom/what, or for whom/what is the action done)*. 
<br /><br />This one can be a little bit confused to us, since it sounds like we're talking about `المغعول به`; think of it like `المضاف اليه`; hopefully that makes sense, if not, then continue to the example :). **Example**: *The man gives the woman a book*; `the woman` is the **dative** here. 
<br /><br /> Now if you examine the example closely, you notice that the main action `gives` was done by `the man` to the `book`; the `book` is actually the thing that has been given; and `the woman` is the one who got the book; so `she` was the one whom got the damn book 😂!

<br />

- **Genitive Case**: this is used to show the **relationship** between two nouns. It indicates that one item **belongs** to the other. It's basically `حالة التملّك` :). **Example**: *The man's house*.

<br />

- **Clause**: a group of words containing a verb, in Arabic, it's something like `فقرة` ;).

<br />

- **Conjugation**: to give a verb **different endings** according to whether you are referring to *I*, *you*, *they* and so on, and according to whether you are referring to *past*, *present* or *future*. In Arabic, it's called `تصريف الافعال`.

<br />

- **Imperative**: the form of a verb used when **giving orders** and **instructions**. In Arabic, it's called `صيغة الامر`. **Example**: *Shut the fuk up!* 😜.

<br />

- **Preposition**: a word such as *at*, *for*, *with*, *into* or *from*, which is usually followed by a **noun**, **pronoun** or, in English, a word ending in -ing . Prepositions show how people and things **relate** to the rest of the sentence. In Arabic, we call those `حروف الجر`.
