# The German Alphabet - Part Two

Now we know about the German alphabet, it's time to continue learning about the rest :).

::: warning
Things here might seem too much for you, but you really don't have to worry about them too much now; after all, you gonna see these letters in words, and you'll learn how they're pronounced by time ;).

<br />

- **√Ñ**: This one sounds very much like the German `e`, which, in case you forget, pronounced like the `ŸÅÿ™ÿ≠ÿ©` in Arabic, or a soft `a` in English.
**Example**: `Sp√§t` means *Late*.

- **√ñ**: This one is over explained in many books I've read! to me, it sounds like a short hard `o`; just remember to round your lips while saying it :O.
**Example**: `√ñl` means *Oil*.

- **√ú**: Round your lips hard, but **instead** of saying long `o`, say long `e`, try it, it's funny :D.
**Example**: `√úber` means *Over* | `T√ºr` means *Door*.

- **√ü**: That's just a double `s` combined together; pronounced as the English `s`.
**Example**: `Stra√üe` means *Street*.

<br />

That's it! Promise, no more letters :D, that's all the German alphabet. Pat yourself on the back, feel accomplished, and see you in the next lesson üëã.
