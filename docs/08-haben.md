# The Verb: Haben | Present Tense

This verb is an important one to learn, it means `to have` and it's been used all over the place; however not like English, this verb has more than just two forms in German.

I mean in English, you have `have` and `has`; and then you have `had` in the past tenses. In German, however, there's more to it.

The good thing though, is the fact that learning about this verb's conjugation will help us learn about other verbs conjugation; because many verbs do share the same grammar's rule. 😁

<!-- :::tip
Before going any further, let's learn two things about verbs. **The first thing** is the fact that all verbs have a `Stem`, which is the main part of a verb to which endings are added; it's something like `الفعل المجرد` in Arabic; *(ex. go, move, ..etc.)*. **The second thing** is that all verbs have an `Infinitive` form, which is `المصدر` or `جذر الفعل` in Arabic; *(ex. to wait, to go .. etc.)*.

With that's out of the way, let's continue with the verb **haben**; shall we? ;)

**Haben** is irregular verb *(just like in English)*, however the endings that added to it with each pronoun is kinda the same with other verbs ;)
