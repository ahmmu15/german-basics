# Pronunciation: The Basics (Part Two)

So you're here again! willing to learn more about pronunciation! that's great! Let's go then :)!

<br />

- **Short Vowels**: in German spelling `two consonants` after a `vowel` will normally indicate it is **short**.
**Example**: `Hand` means *Hand* | `Bett` means *Bed* | `Pilz` means *Mushroom* | `Schloss` means *Lock* | `TÃ¶chter` means *Daughters* | `Zunge` means *Tongue* | `FlÃ¼sse` means *Rivers*.

- **Long Vowels**: only `one consonant` after a `vowel` indicates it is **long**.
**Example**: `Vater` means *Father* | `VaÌˆter` means *Fathers* | `Lesen` means *Read* | `Liga` means *League* | `Rot` means *Red* | `SchoÌˆn` means *Beautiful* | `Gut` means *Good* | `TrÃ¼be` means *Cloudy*.

::: tip
Sometimes you come accross words like `Zahlen`, means *Numbers*, and you think: well, that's a short `a` because there're two consonants after it, the `h` and the `l`, right? The answer is no, the `a` here is **long**, because the `h` is silent ;).

Another thing to pay attention to is the `consonant sound`; for example the `ch` is made of two letters, but it's pronounced as **one** sound; an example of that would be `Buch`, which means *Book*. The `u` is **long** here as well.

### Consonants in German
 Because we know English, and because German looks like English; we might fall for some tricks here and there; but fear not lady; we're here to learn how to avoid that ;).

 <br />

- **B**: it's like the English `B`, but if you see it in the **end** of a word, then it is `P`!
**Example**: `ab` means *from* | `Lob` means *Praise*.

- **Chs**: this combination is pronounced like the English `x`.
**Example**: `Sechs` means *Six* | `Fuchs` means *Fox*.

- **Ch**: at the beginning of loanwords is pronounced like `k`, `sh` or the soft german `ch`; depending on the **source language**.
**Example**: `Chaos` means *Chaos* | `Chance` means *Chance* | `China` means *China*.

::: tip
I don't think you have to worry about that at all! You just have to look for the word you wanna learn, and then learn how the `ch` in it should be pronounced ;).
:::

<br />

- **Ck**: you find this in the middle and the end of German words, and it pronounced as the English `K`.
**Example**: `Lecker` means *Delicious* | `Fleck` means *Stain*.


- **D**: it's like the English `D`, but it's a `T` if you see it in the **end** of a word.
**Example**: `Gold` means *Gold* | `Hand` means *Hand*.

- **G**: at the **beginning** or in the **middle** of words is pronounced as `Ú¯`; where it's `K` in the **end** of the word.
**Example**: `Gang` means *Gear* | `Fliegen` means *Fly*.

- **ig**: at the **end** of the word is pronounced like German `ich`.
 **Example**: `KoÌˆnig` means *King* | `Lustig` means *Funny*.

 - **Pf**: that one looks weird, but it's commmon in German, and pronounced just like the way it looks :D!
 **Example**: `Pferd` means *Hourse* | `Kopf` means *Head*.

 - **Ph**: is still used in some loanwords and is pronounced as `F`.
 **Example**: `Photograph` means *Photographer* | `Philosophie` means *Philosophy*.

 - **Q**:  always occurs in combination with `U`, as in English, and together they are pronounced `kv`.
 **Example**: `QualitaÌˆt` means *Quality* | `Quelle` means *Source*.


<br />

Okey, that one is getting out of hand, so let's cut it here :D .. See you in the next lesson ðŸ¤“.
