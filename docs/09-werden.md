# The Verb: Werden | Present Tense

Another important verb in German; it means `become` or `get` *(`get` like in `getting old` or `getting cold`)*, and it describes what a person **becomes** or **how conditions are changing**. Oh, and it's also an *irregular* verb. :D 

## Singular Forms

- **Ich werde:** That's how to say `I become / I get`, or `I'm becoming / I'm getting`.
<br />
**Example:** Ich **werd<span class="tomato">e</span>** Zahnarzt ‚û°Ô∏è `I'm becoming a dentist`
<br /><br />

:::tip NOTE
Notice that you **don't use** `a` nor `an` when you talk about a **profession** in German; for example, you say **Ich bin doktor** and **<span class="tomato">NOT</span>** *Ich bin ein doktor* ;)
:::

- **Du wirst:** That's how to say **(informally)** `You become / You get`, or `You're becoming / You're getting`.
<br />
**Example:** Du **wir<span class="tomato">st</span>** krank ‚û°Ô∏è `You're getting sick`
<br /><br />

- **Er wird:** That's how to say `He becomes / He gets`, or `He's becoming / He's getting`.
<br />
**Example:** Er **wird** gesund ‚û°Ô∏è `He gets healthy`
<br /><br />

- **sie wird:** That's how to say `She becomes / She gets`, or `She's becoming / She's getting`.
<br />
**Example:** sie **wird** Krankenschwester ‚û°Ô∏è `She becomes a nurse`

:::tip NOTE
**Krank** means *patient*, **kranken** is *patients* and **schwester** is *sister*; all the words combined togther means *nurse*. The literal translation is *patients sister*! :D
